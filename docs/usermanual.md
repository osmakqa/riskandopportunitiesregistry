3.  **Description**: Write a clear description of the issue. Use the **Suggest** button for AI assistance.
4.  **Impact & Controls (Risks Only)**:
    *   **Impact on QMS**: Define what happens if this risk occurs (e.g., patient delay, safety breach).
    *   **Existing Controls**: List what you currently have in place to manage this risk.
5.  **Rate the Risk**:
    *   Use the **Likelihood** (1-5) and **Severity** (1-5) sliders.
    *   The system will automatically assign a **Risk Level** (Low, Moderate, High, or Critical).
6.  **Action Plan**:
    *   Choose a **Strategy** (e.g., Mitigate, Transfer, Avoid).
    *   Write the specific **Action Plan** description.

2.  **Mark as Completed**:
    *   Once done, find the item in your dashboard and click the **"Completed"** button.
3.  **Enter Residual Data**:
    *   You **must** re-rate the risk (Likelihood and Severity) to show the "Residual Risk" after your action.
    *   **Overdue Justification**: If you missed your target date, you must provide a **Reason for Delay**.
4.  **Wait for IQA**: The item moves to the IQA queue for verification.

2.  **Verify Effectiveness**: 
    *   Check if the **Residual Risk Rating** is satisfactory. 
    *   If effective, mark as **"Effective"** and **"Implemented"** to **Close** the entry.
